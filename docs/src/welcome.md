# Welcome to LSDO GeNIe

The LSDO Lab's Gemoetric Non-Interference (GeNIe) constraint formulation is an efficient and scalable method to enforce non-interference constraints in gradient-based optimization. We define geometric non-interference as a constraint to enforce such that the design body does not interfere with any other geometric shape in the environment. Geometric non-interference constraints appear in layout optimization, optimal path planning optimization, and shape optimization problems.

In the diagram below, geometric non-interference is enforced between the design body and the infeasible space outside of the grey geometric shape. In gradient-based optimization, a constraint function $\phi(\mathbf{x})\geq0$, where $\mathbf{x}$ is the design variables, must be enforced to prevent the design body from interfering with the infeasible region. It is required that $\phi$ is continuous and differentiable for gradient-based optimization and desired that it is fast-to-evaluate, scalable, and an accurate representation of the boundary $\Gamma$ between the feasible $\phi(\mathbf{x})>0$ and infeasible $\phi(\mathbf{x})<0$ spaces. The focus of this package is on generating the geometric non-interferencee constraint function $\phi$.
